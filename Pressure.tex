		Such pressure.
	\end{center}
	No coherent thought. Not at 3am. I hear the mathematics, but cannot respond. I want to get rid of this pressure in my head, but yet it remains. I should try to get some sleep.
	
	I don't know where this pull originates, but I constantly feel the need to think towards that one goal, the only thing that matters.
	
	I make another attempt at thinking. But I am too tired to do anything anymore. There is next to the call, the pull, the melody of mathematics also my pride carrying me into such late nights. And I almost always yield to this pair.
	
	Sleep
